# Predicting-Loan-Repay-using-Keras-Deep-Learning

Summary: Uses exploratory data analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, feature normalization, and Keras Tensorflow to predict whether or not a loan is likely to be repaid by the borrower.

Conclusion:
A working model that can be saved and loaded from the users instance machine. Model performance was showen to not overfit. The number of loans that were not paid were clear to have fewer data points when training which led to a low recall.

Libaries used: NumPy, Seaborn, Pandas, Matplotlib, sklearn.model_selection, tensorflow.keras.models and layers.

This project was part of "Python in Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" on Udemy.
